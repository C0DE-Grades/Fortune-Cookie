  <p>Because this had basically the other things we needed to do, I (unknowingly) did them all in this so I didn't had to do the others.<br>Anyways, they're called Tarot Cards.<br><br>There's 78 cards in total but have 2 different meaning if it's either upright or not which makes it to 156 definitions I had to read and rewrite to shorten the meanings. Which mainly was the main reason why I also took awhile to make (took over a month or something, I forgot).<br><br>It was very time comsuming and boring :( </p>
